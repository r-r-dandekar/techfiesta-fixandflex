## Installation

Currently, we're using Python 3.10.12. We might change it later depending on the needs of our libraries

Please create a virtual environment while installing!
```
python -m venv venv
```
Or, for Linux,
```
virtualenv venv
```

Activate your virtual environment (don't skip this step!)
For Windows cmd:
```
./venv/Scripts/activate
For Linux:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then install requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
